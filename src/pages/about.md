      Computers for Kids is a community service-oriented technology clubs that
      refurbishes donated computers which are then distributed to families in
      need in our community. We also provide free, after-school PC-building
      lessons every Monday afternoons.


      Some of the club functions:


      * Refurbish and repair broken computers at the Network Operations Center
      (NOC)

      * Educate members about PCs with weekly workshops and hands-on build
      sessions

      * Spread our passion for PCs/technology with new members around the
      school.

      * Teach students who are interested in computers about assembling their
      own PCs through a care-package system.

      * We work closely with TE-Cares to donate computers to families in the
      surrounding area. More information can be found at this link below:
